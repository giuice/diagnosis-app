# IP5_AppShell Implementation Plan

## Objective
Design and implement the main application shell, including landing page, layout, and navigation integration.

## Context
The current app lacks a dedicated UI shell and main page design. This plan addresses the integration of chat, navigation, and metadata display in a responsive layout.

## Dependencies
- IP1_ChatInterface (chat components)
- IP3_SessionManagement (session state)
- IP4_DiagnosticHistory (history view)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components

## Tasks
- **T21_AppShell_and_MainPage**: Implement main app shell, customize `page.tsx`, layout, and navigation

## Phases
### Phase 1: Layout Design
- Define sidebar/header navigation
- Plan responsive grid/flex layout

### Phase 2: Component Integration
- Embed ChatContainer
- Add navigation controls (history, new diagnosis, export)
- Display session metadata

### Phase 3: Styling
- Apply Tailwind CSS styling
- Use shadcn/ui components
- Ensure dark/light mode compatibility

### Phase 4: Testing
- Verify chat and navigation integration
- Check responsiveness and accessibility

## Expected Output
A polished, user-friendly app shell with integrated chat, navigation, and metadata display.

## Notes
- Keep initial implementation simple; enhance iteratively
- Plan for future expansion (settings, multi-language)
