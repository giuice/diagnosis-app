# IP2_APIIntegration

## Overview
This implementation plan covers the integration of the OpenAI API for the diagnostic AI functionality of the app. It includes API route creation, secure API key management, request/response handling, and the implementation of the system prompt for diagnosis.

## Goals
- Create secure API routes for OpenAI communication
- Implement proper API key management using environment variables
- Send appropriate system prompts with user messages to guide the AI
- Handle API responses and errors effectively
- Implement response streaming if needed
- Ensure reliable and efficient API communication

## Components
- API Route: Next.js API route for OpenAI communication
- OpenAI Client: Configuration for OpenAI API calls
- Response Handler: Processing and formatting API responses
- Error Handler: Managing API errors and fallbacks
- Environment Configuration: Setup for secure API key storage

## Technical Approach
- Use Next.js API routes for secure backend functionality
- Store OpenAI API key in environment variables (both local and Vercel)
- Implement React Query for API state management and caching
- Create a system prompt to guide the AI's diagnostic approach
- Add appropriate error handling and retry logic
- Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive API usage
- Consider streaming responses for better user experience

## Related Tasks
- T6_APIRouteSetup - Creating the Next.js API route for OpenAI
- T7_EnvironmentConfig - Setting up environment variables for API keys
- T8_SystemPrompt - Implementing the diagnostic system prompt
- T9_ErrorHandling - Creating robust error handling for API calls
- T10_ResponseProcessing - Processing and formatting API responses

## Timeline
- API route setup: 0.5 day
- Environment configuration: 0.25 day
- System prompt implementation: 0.5 day
- Error handling: 0.25 day
- Response processing: 0.25 day
- Total estimated time: 1.75 days

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: API key exposure - Mitigation: Use environment variables and Vercel secrets
- Risk: Rate limiting/quotas - Mitigation: Implement request throttling and caching
- Risk: Unreliable responses - Mitigation: Strong error handling and fallback content
- Risk: High latency - Mitigation: Loading states and potentially response streaming
