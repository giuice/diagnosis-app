# IP3_SessionManagement

## Overview
This implementation plan covers the session management functionality of the Diagnosis Web App, allowing users to start new diagnostic sessions and maintain the current session state. It includes the state management for chat sessions, new session creation, and session persistence logic.

## Goals
- Implement "New Diagnosis" button for starting fresh sessions
- Store current session state in memory using Zustand
- Save completed sessions to browser localStorage
- Maintain conversation context and history within sessions
- Ensure smooth transitions between sessions
- Provide session metadata like timestamps

## Components
- SessionStore: Zustand store for managing session state
- NewDiagnosisButton: UI component to start a new session
- SessionPersistence: Functionality to save/load sessions
- SessionMetadata: Management of session timestamps and titles
- LocalStorageService: Interface for browser storage interaction

## Technical Approach
- Use Zustand for in-memory state management of the current session
- Implement localStorage for persistent session storage
- Create utility functions for session serialization/deserialization
- Add session metadata (timestamps, unique IDs)
- Handle graceful degradation when storage is unavailable
- Implement session pruning to avoid storage limits

## Related Tasks
- T11_SessionStore - Creating Zustand store for session management
- T12_NewDiagnosisButton - Implementing new session functionality
- T13_LocalStoragePersistence - Saving sessions to browser storage
- T14_SessionMetadata - Adding timestamps and identifiers to sessions
- T15_StorageUtilities - Creating utility functions for storage operations

## Timeline
- Session store implementation: 0.5 day
- New diagnosis button: 0.25 day
- Local storage persistence: 0.5 day
- Session metadata: 0.25 day
- Testing and refinement: 0.25 day
- Total estimated time: 1.75 days

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: LocalStorage size limits - Mitigation: Session pruning and compression
- Risk: Data loss - Mitigation: Automatic saving at regular intervals
- Risk: Browser compatibility - Mitigation: Feature detection and fallbacks
- Risk: Session state complexity - Mitigation: Clear state management patterns
