# IP6_LayoutAndBugFixes

## Overview
A comprehensive plan to improve the application's layout, fix existing bugs, and enhance mobile responsiveness to create a better user experience.

## Goals
- Improve the overall layout and visual design of the application
- Fix identified bugs and edge cases
- Enhance mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
- Create a more consistent and accessible user interface

## Technical Approach
We will take a three-pronged approach:

1. **Layout Improvements**: Focus on consolidating duplicate controls, standardizing spacing and alignment, enhancing navigation with clear breadcrumbs, and improving the visual design.

2. **Bug Fixes**: Address existing bugs related to empty session handling, error handling in API calls, navigation state management, loading state issues, and session resumption edge cases.

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Implement mobile-first optimizations including responsive typography, touch-optimized UI elements, appropriate mobile navigation, and swipe gestures.

The improvements will maintain backward compatibility and follow the established design system while enhancing the user experience.

## Related Tasks
- T6_1_LayoutImprovements - Consolidate controls, improve navigation, and standardize layout
- T6_2_BugFixes - Fix issues with empty sessions, error handling, and state management
- T6_3_MobileResponsiveness - Enhance mobile experience with touch optimization and responsive design

## Timeline & Risks
### Timeline
- Layout Improvements: 3-4 days
- Bug Fixes: 2-3 days
- Mobile Responsiveness: 2-3 days

### Risks
- Changes to layout might affect existing functionality
- Bug fixes may introduce new bugs if not carefully tested
- Mobile improvements may degrade desktop experience if not properly implemented

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing after each task
- Phased implementation to isolate changes
- Responsive testing across multiple device sizes
