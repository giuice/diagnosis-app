# IP1_ChatInterface

## Overview
This implementation plan covers the chat interface component of the Diagnosis Web App, which is the core functionality that allows users to interact with the AI diagnosis assistant. It includes the UI components for the chat interface, message handling, and user input functionality.

## Goals
- Create a responsive and intuitive chat interface for entering symptoms
- Implement message rendering for both user inputs and AI responses
- Handle user input submissions and validation
- Display appropriate loading states during AI responses
- Implement smooth scrolling and auto-scrolling to latest messages
- Ensure the chat interface is accessible and user-friendly

## Components
- ChatContainer: Main wrapper component for the chat interface
- MessageList: Component to render the conversation history
- MessageItem: Individual message component (user or AI)
- InputArea: User input form with submit button
- LoadingIndicator: Visual indicator for when AI is processing
- ChatControls: Additional controls for the chat (e.g., clear, export)

## Technical Approach
- Use Next.js with React for the frontend implementation
- Implement components using shadcn/ui for consistent styling
- Style components with Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Use Zustand for state management of the chat session
- Implement chat scrolling with useRef and useEffect hooks
- Use React Query for API request management
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for improved usability

## Related Tasks
- T1_ChatContainer - Main chat container and layout implementation
- T2_MessageComponents - Message rendering and styling
- T3_InputHandling - User input submission and validation
- T4_ChatStateManagement - Chat state management with Zustand
- T5_LoadingStates - Loading states and visual indicators

## Timeline
- Design and layout: 1 day
- Core message components: 1 day
- Input handling: 0.5 day
- State management: 0.5 day
- Styling and UX improvements: 0.5 day
- Total estimated time: 3.5 days

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Poor mobile responsiveness - Mitigation: Use mobile-first approach with Tailwind
- Risk: Slow rendering with many messages - Mitigation: Implement virtualized lists if needed
- Risk: Accessibility issues - Mitigation: Ensure ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Risk: UX complexity - Mitigation: Conduct usability testing early
