**Current Phase:** EXECUTION

## Last Completed Action
- Completed step 1 of T6_2_BugFixes: Enhanced empty session handling
- Audited all session creation entry points for empty session validation
- Ensured user-friendly error messages and UI feedback for empty session attempts
- Confirmed store-level and UI-level prevention of empty session creation
- All entry points now block empty sessions and provide consistent feedback

## Current Focus
- Following IP6_LayoutAndBugFixes implementation plan with two remaining tasks:
  1. T6_2_BugFixes - Fix issues with empty sessions, error handling, and state management
  2. T6_3_MobileResponsiveness - Enhance mobile experience with touch optimization
- Next task to implement: T6_2_BugFixes

## Next Steps
- Begin step 2 of T6_2_BugFixes: Improve error handling in API calls
- Implement more granular error types and retry logic for API failures
- Create user-friendly error displays and ensure app consistency after errors
- After completing T6_2_BugFixes, implement T6_3_MobileResponsiveness

## Notes
- DeepSeek API call now prepends system prompt if missing
- Transitioned from strategy to execution phase
- Chat now calls real API and formats responses
- Session creation now checks for messages and blocks empty sessions in UI and store
- User resumes a session and is immediately taken to chat interface
