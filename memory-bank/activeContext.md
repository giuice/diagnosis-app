**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the Diagnosis Web App project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:**  List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on. Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- **Next Steps:**  List the immediate next steps required to advance the project. Prioritize and order these steps for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered or actively debated. Capture the essence of the decision and any open questions.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans (these belong in other memory bank files like `progress.md` or dedicated documentation).
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state of the project. Regularly review and prune outdated information.

**Current Phase:** EXECUTION

## Notes
- DeepSeek API call now prepends system prompt if missing
