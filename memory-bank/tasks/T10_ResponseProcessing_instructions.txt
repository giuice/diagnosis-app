# T10_ResponseProcessing Instructions

## Objective
Implement functionality to process, format, and optimize OpenAI API responses for display in the chat interface, ensuring optimal user experience.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP2_APIIntegration
This task focuses on processing and formatting the responses received from the OpenAI API to ensure they are presented appropriately in the chat interface, with proper formatting, parsing, and optimization.

## Dependencies
- T6_APIRouteSetup (source of the API responses)
- T2_MessageComponents (will display the processed responses)
- T4_ChatStateManagement (will store the processed responses)

## Steps
1. Create response processing utilities:
   - Create file: `src/lib/utils/responseProcessor.ts`
   - Implement functions to parse OpenAI responses
   - Add content extraction and formatting
   - Create markdown parsing functionality if needed
   - Implement response validation

2. Add response formatting:
   - Implement text formatting for readability
   - Add support for markdown rendering
   - Create functions for handling special response formats
   - Implement consistent formatting for medical terms

3. Optimize response handling:
   - Add caching mechanisms if appropriate
   - Implement response chunking for large responses
   - Optimize for performance and render efficiency
   - Add support for streaming responses if implemented

4. Create response transformation utilities:
   - Implement functions to extract key information
   - Add highlight/emphasis for important medical advice
   - Create functionality to format diagnostic summaries
   - Implement structured data extraction if needed

5. Connect with UI components:
   - Ensure processed responses work with message components
   - Test rendering of various response types
   - Verify accessibility of processed responses
   - Implement proper sanitization for security

## Expected Output
A robust response processing system that:
- Properly formats and optimizes API responses for display
- Handles various response formats and structures
- Enhances readability and user experience
- Maintains proper security through sanitization
- Integrates seamlessly with the chat interface components

## Notes
- Focus on readability and clarity of medical information
- Consider performance implications for large responses
- Ensure proper sanitization to prevent XSS vulnerabilities
- Test with various response formats and edge cases
- Consider accessibility implications of formatted responses
