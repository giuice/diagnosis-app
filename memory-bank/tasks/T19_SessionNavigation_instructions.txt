# T19_SessionNavigation Instructions

## Objective
Implement navigation functionality between the active chat interface and history view, allowing users to seamlessly switch between current and past diagnostic sessions.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP4_DiagnosticHistory
This task focuses on creating the navigation system that lets users move between the active chat and the history view, providing a cohesive user experience across the application.

## Dependencies
- T1_ChatContainer (active chat interface)
- T16_HistoryView (history listing)
- T17_SessionViewer (session viewing)
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS

## Steps
1. Create navigation component:
   - Create file: `src/components/navigation/SessionNavigation.tsx`
   - Implement tab or switch interface
   - Add active indicators for current view
   - Create responsive layout for different device sizes

2. Implement state management for navigation:
   - Create view state tracking
   - Implement view switching logic
   - Add URL-based navigation (optional)
   - Preserve state between view switches

3. Add navigation triggers:
   - Implement click handlers for tab/switch interface
   - Create keyboard shortcuts for navigation
   - Add breadcrumb navigation for nested views
   - Implement back button functionality

4. Create smooth transitions:
   - Add animation between view changes
   - Implement loading states for view transitions
   - Create proper focus management
   - Ensure scroll position is preserved when appropriate

5. Integrate with layout:
   - Add navigation to main application layout
   - Ensure proper mobile adaptability
   - Create consistent styling with application theme
   - Implement proper ARIA roles for accessibility

## Expected Output
A navigation system that:
- Allows users to switch between active chat and history views
- Provides clear visual indication of current view
- Maintains state appropriately during navigation
- Integrates seamlessly with the application layout
- Works well across different device sizes

## Notes
- Focus on creating an intuitive navigation experience
- Consider how to handle unsaved changes during navigation
- Ensure navigation is accessible via keyboard
- Add appropriate animations without being distracting
- Consider URL-based routing for direct linking to views
