# T7_EnvironmentConfig Instructions

## Objective
Set up secure environment variables for storing API keys and other sensitive configuration, ensuring proper functionality in both development and production environments.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP2_APIIntegration
This task focuses on creating and configuring environment variables to securely store the OpenAI API key and other sensitive configuration data needed for the application.

## Dependencies
- T6_APIRouteSetup (will use the environment configuration)
- Next.js environment variables system
- Vercel deployment (for production environment)

## Steps
1. Set up local environment variables:
   - Create file: `.env.local` in the project root
   - Define `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable
   - Add other necessary configuration variables
   - Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets

2. Set up environment variable typing:
   - Create environment type definitions
   - Add environment variable validation
   - Create utility for accessing environment variables

3. Create example environment file:
   - Create file: `.env.example` with placeholder values
   - Document required environment variables
   - Include setup instructions for new developers

4. Configure Vercel environment:
   - Add environment variables to Vercel project
   - Ensure proper encryption for sensitive values
   - Test environment variable access in production

5. Implement environment variable access in code:
   - Create utility function to safely access environment variables
   - Add error handling for missing environment variables
   - Ensure proper typing for environment variable access

## Expected Output
A secure environment variable configuration that:
- Properly stores and protects API keys and sensitive data
- Works in both development and production environments
- Includes documentation for required environment variables
- Has proper error handling for missing configuration
- Integrates with the API route for secure OpenAI communication

## Notes
- Never commit API keys or other secrets to the repository
- Use proper validation to fail early if environment variables are missing
- Consider using a library like `zod` for environment variable validation
- Provide clear documentation for setting up environment variables
