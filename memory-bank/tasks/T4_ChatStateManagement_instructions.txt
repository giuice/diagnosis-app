# T4_ChatStateManagement Instructions

## Objective
Implement state management for the chat interface using Zustand, including message handling, conversation context, and integration with UI components.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP1_ChatInterface
This task focuses on implementing the state management for the chat interface, which will handle messages, maintain conversation context, and provide the necessary state and functions to the UI components.

## Dependencies
- Zustand for state management
- T1_ChatContainer, T2_MessageComponents, T3_InputHandling (will use this state)
- React Query (for API integration)

## Steps
1. ✅ Set up the chat store using Zustand:
   - Create file: `src/store/useChatStore.ts`
   - Define message types and interfaces
   - Create store with necessary state and actions
   - Implement persist middleware for local storage (optional)

2. ✅ Implement message management functions:
   - Add function to add user messages
   - Add function to add AI messages
   - Add function to update message status (loading, error, etc.)
   - Add function to clear messages

3. ✅ Create conversation context management:
   - Implement conversation history tracking
   - Maintain message order and timestamps
   - Set up conversation metadata (session ID, start time, etc.)

4. ✅ Connect store to components:
   - Create hooks or utilities for components to consume state
   - Set up message dispatch from input component
   - Connect message display to the message components
   - Update loading states appropriately

5. ✅ Prepare for API integration:
   - Add placeholders for API call handlers
   - Set up loading states for API calls
   - Implement error handling for failed requests

## Expected Output
A complete state management solution that:
- Manages chat messages and conversation state
- Provides necessary actions for adding and updating messages
- Connects seamlessly with UI components
- Is prepared for integration with the API
- Maintains proper state during user interactions

## Notes
- Focus on creating a clean and maintainable state architecture
- Consider performance implications for potentially large message lists
- Use TypeScript for strong typing of state and actions
- Plan for future integration with session management functionality
