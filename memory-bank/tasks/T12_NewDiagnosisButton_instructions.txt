# T12_NewDiagnosisButton Instructions

## Objective
Implement a button component that allows users to start a new diagnostic session while saving the current session to history.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP3_SessionManagement
This task focuses on creating the "New Diagnosis" button component and its associated functionality, enabling users to start fresh diagnostic conversations while preserving their history.

## Dependencies
- T11_SessionStore (provides the session management functionality)
- T4_ChatStateManagement (needs to be cleared for new sessions)
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS

## Steps
1. ✅ Create the button component:
   - Create file: `src/components/session/NewDiagnosisButton.tsx`
   - Implement button UI using shadcn/ui Button component
   - Add appropriate icon (e.g., plus sign or document)
   - Style with Tailwind CSS for consistency

2. ✅ Implement click handler:
   - Create function to handle new session creation
   - Add confirmation dialog if current session has content
   - Connect to session store for saving current session
   - Implement functionality to reset chat state

3. ✅ Add session transition logic:
   - Save current session to history before clearing
   - Generate new session ID and metadata
   - Implement smooth transition between sessions
   - Add success notification or feedback

4. ✅ Integrate with layout:
   - Add button to appropriate location in UI
   - Consider placement for optimal visibility and access
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness
   - Add keyboard shortcut (optional)

5. ✅ Implement accessibility:
   - Add proper ARIA attributes
   - Ensure keyboard navigation
   - Include appropriate focus states
   - Add descriptive tooltip

## Expected Output
A functional New Diagnosis button that:
- Visually integrates with the app's design
- Saves the current session before starting a new one
- Creates a new, empty diagnostic session
- Provides appropriate user feedback
- Is accessible and easy to use

## Notes
- Consider user confirmation for non-empty sessions to prevent accidental data loss
- Ensure smooth visual transition between sessions
- Test on various devices and screen sizes
- Consider adding "untitled" or timestamp-based naming for automatic session naming
