# T15_StorageUtilities Instructions

## Objective
Create utility functions for storage operations, including session data management, storage optimization, and error handling for persistent data.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP3_SessionManagement
This task focuses on developing utility functions for working with browser storage, handling edge cases, and providing consistent interfaces for session data operations.

## Dependencies
- T11_SessionStore (will use these utilities)
- T13_LocalStoragePersistence (will incorporate these utilities)
- T14_SessionMetadata (storage operations will include metadata)

## Steps
1. Create storage utility library:
   - Create file: `src/lib/utils/storageUtils.ts`
   - Implement helper functions for storage operations
   - Add type-safe interfaces for data access
   - Create error handling wrappers

2. Implement storage availability detection:
   - Add function to detect localStorage availability
   - Create fallback mechanism for unavailable storage
   - Implement storage size checking
   - Add quota monitoring functionality

3. Create data optimization utilities:
   - Implement session data compression (if needed)
   - Add functions for efficient data serialization
   - Create utilities for batch operations
   - Implement data integrity validation

4. Add data migration functionality:
   - Create version checking for stored data
   - Implement data structure migration helpers
   - Add backward compatibility utilities
   - Create data repair functions

5. Implement storage management utilities:
   - Add functions for storage cleanup
   - Create utilities for prioritized data pruning
   - Implement session archiving functionality (optional)
   - Add data export/import utilities

## Expected Output
A comprehensive set of storage utilities that:
- Provides consistent interfaces for storage operations
- Handles edge cases and error conditions gracefully
- Optimizes data storage and retrieval
- Ensures data integrity and backwards compatibility
- Simplifies storage operations throughout the application

## Notes
- Focus on error handling and recovery
- Consider browser inconsistencies in localStorage implementation
- Ensure utilities work across different browsers
- Document size limitations and optimization strategies
- Consider adding IndexedDB support for larger storage needs (future enhancement)
