# T14_SessionMetadata Instructions

## Objective
Implement functionality to manage session metadata such as timestamps, titles, IDs, and other identifying information for diagnostic sessions.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP3_SessionManagement
This task focuses on creating the utilities and structures needed to maintain and display metadata for diagnostic sessions, enabling better organization and identification of saved sessions.

## Dependencies
- T11_SessionStore (will use the metadata)
- T13_LocalStoragePersistence (will store metadata)
- Date/time utilities

## Steps
1. ✅ Define session metadata structure:
   - Create file: `src/lib/types/sessionTypes.ts`
   - Define interfaces for session metadata
   - Include fields for timestamp, title, ID, etc.
   - Add typing for metadata operations

2. ✅ Implement metadata generation:
   - Create utility for generating unique session IDs
   - Implement timestamp generation and formatting
   - Add function for automatic title generation
   - Create utilities for metadata validation

3. ✅ Add metadata management:
   - Implement functions to update session metadata
   - Create utilities for sorting by metadata
   - Add filtering by metadata properties
   - Implement search functionality based on metadata

4. ✅ Create display formatting:
   - Add functions to format timestamps for display
   - Implement title truncation and formatting
   - Create utilities for displaying session duration
   - Add relative time formatting (e.g., "2 days ago")

5. ✅ Connect with session operations:
   - Integrate metadata generation with new sessions
   - Add metadata updates during session operations
   - Implement metadata in session listings
   - Ensure metadata persistence with sessions

## Expected Output
A comprehensive metadata system that:
- Provides clear identification for each session
- Includes useful timestamps and title information
- Enables sorting and filtering of sessions
- Integrates with the session management system
- Enhances the user experience with informative display

## Notes
- Consider time zone handling for timestamps
- Ensure unique IDs even in offline/concurrent creation
- User-friendly titles should aid in quick session identification
- Consider adding custom tagging capability (optional enhancement)
- Ensure metadata is lightweight to minimize storage impact
