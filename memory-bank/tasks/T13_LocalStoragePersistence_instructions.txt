# T13_LocalStoragePersistence Instructions

## Objective
Implement functionality to save, load, and manage diagnostic sessions in the browser's local storage for persistent history.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP3_SessionManagement
This task focuses on developing the utilities and services needed to persist diagnostic sessions in the browser's local storage, allowing users to access their session history across page refreshes and browser sessions.

## Dependencies
- T11_SessionStore (will use this functionality)
- localStorage API
- JSON serialization/deserialization

## Steps
1. ✅ Create storage service:
   - Create file: `src/lib/services/storageService.ts`
   - Implement functions for localStorage operations
   - Add feature detection for localStorage availability
   - Create error handling for storage failures

2. ✅ Implement session serialization:
   - Create functions to serialize session data to JSON
   - Implement deserialization from JSON to session objects
   - Handle circular references or complex objects
   - Add data validation for loaded sessions

3. ✅ Create storage management functions:
   - Implement functions to save session to storage
   - Add functionality to retrieve all stored sessions
   - Create functions to delete specific sessions
   - Implement storage limit management

4. ✅ Add storage optimization:
   - Implement session compression if needed
   - Create storage usage monitoring
   - Add automatic pruning of old sessions if storage is full
   - Implement session metadata indexing for faster access

5. ✅ Connect with session store:
   - Integrate storage service with session store
   - Implement automatic saving on session changes
   - Add loading of session history on app initialization
   - Create proper error recovery for storage failures

## Expected Output
A robust storage system that:
- Reliably persists diagnostic sessions in localStorage
- Manages storage limits and optimization
- Handles errors and edge cases gracefully
- Provides clean integration with the session store
- Allows for session history management

## Notes
- localStorage has a size limit (usually 5-10MB per domain)
- Consider implementing a strategy for handling storage limits
- Test with large sessions to ensure reliability
- Implement graceful degradation when localStorage is unavailable
- Consider adding export/import functionality for backup
