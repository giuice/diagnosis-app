# T16_PreventEmptySessions Instructions

## Objective
Prevent the creation and saving of empty diagnostic sessions without any user or AI messages.

## Context
- Currently, clicking "New Diagnosis" creates a new session even if no messages exist.
- This leads to cluttered history with empty sessions.
- This task is part of IP3_SessionManagement.

## Dependencies
- Zustand session store (T11_SessionStore)
- New Diagnosis button (T12_NewDiagnosisButton)
- Session persistence logic (T13_LocalStoragePersistence)

## Steps
1. Review session creation logic in:
   - `useSessionStore`
   - `NewDiagnosisButton.tsx`
   - Sidebar/menu buttons in `layout.tsx`
2. Before creating or saving a session:
   - Check if the current message list is empty.
   - If empty, do NOT create or save a new session.
3. Optionally, disable the "New Diagnosis" button if no messages exist.
4. Optionally, show a user-friendly warning or tooltip.
5. Test:
   - Creating a new session with messages (should work)
   - Trying to create a new session with no messages (should be prevented)
6. Update unit tests or add new tests for this behavior.
7. Document the fix in code comments and changelog.

## Expected Output
- No empty sessions are created or saved.
- Session history contains only meaningful conversations.
- Improved user experience and data quality.

## Notes
- Coordinate with UI/UX to decide on user feedback when blocked.
- Consider edge cases like rapid clicks or race conditions.
