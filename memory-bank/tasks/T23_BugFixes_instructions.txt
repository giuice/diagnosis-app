# T23: Bug Fixes Instructions

## Objective
Identify and fix existing bugs in the diagnosis app to improve stability, user experience, and prevent edge cases from causing errors.

## Context
The app currently has some potential issues with error handling, empty sessions, and state management that could lead to bugs or poor user experience.

## Dependencies
- src/store/useChatStore.ts
- src/store/useSessionStore.ts
- src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx
- src/components/history/SessionViewer.tsx
- src/app/api/diagnose/route.ts

## Steps

### 1. Enhance Empty Session Handling
- Audit all places where sessions are created, saved, or resumed
- Add consistent validation checks to prevent empty session creation
- Implement user-friendly error messages when attempting to create empty sessions
- Ensure the UI properly reflects when actions can't be performed due to empty sessions

### 2. Improve Error Handling in API Calls
- Implement more granular error types for different API failure scenarios
- Add retry mechanism for network errors with exponential backoff
- Create a more user-friendly error display with actionable advice
- Ensure errors don't leave the app in an inconsistent state

### 3. Fix Navigation State Management
- Review the state transitions between chat, history, and viewer modes
- Fix any race conditions or timing issues during navigation
- Add proper cleanup of resources when switching views
- Ensure the browser history works correctly with the app's internal navigation

### 4. Resolve Loading State Issues
- Implement consistent loading indicators across the app
- Fix any UI jumps that occur during loading state changes
- Add skeleton loaders for smoother transitions
- Ensure loading states don't block UI interaction unnecessarily

### 5. Address Session Resumption Edge Cases
- Test and fix session resumption with various message structures
- Handle corrupted session data gracefully
- Implement recovery mechanisms for partially loaded sessions
- Add validation when loading sessions from localStorage

## Expected Output
- More stable application with fewer unexpected errors
- Consistent user experience even when errors occur
- Proper handling of edge cases like empty sessions or network failures
- Smoother transitions between different app states and views

## Notes
- Write unit tests for critical functions to ensure bug fixes don't regress
- Document any workarounds or special handling for edge cases
- Consider implementing error tracking/logging for future monitoring
