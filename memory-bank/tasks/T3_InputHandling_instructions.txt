# T3_InputHandling Instructions

## Objective
Create the input area component for capturing user messages, including form handling, validation, and submission functionality.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP1_ChatInterface
This task focuses on implementing the input area where users can type their messages and submit them to the AI assistant. It includes form validation, submission handling, and appropriate UI feedback.

## Dependencies
- T1_ChatContainer (input component will be placed within the chat container)
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS
- React Hook Form (optional for form handling)

## Steps
1. Create the InputArea component:
   - Create file: `src/components/chat/InputArea.tsx`
   - Implement a form with textarea/input and submit button
   - Style the component using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
   - Add proper spacing and responsive layout

2. Implement form handling:
   - Create state for input value
   - Handle input changes
   - Implement form submission
   - Clear input after submission
   - Prevent empty message submission

3. Add message submission functionality:
   - Create handleSubmit function
   - Integrate with message sending callback (placeholder for now)
   - Validate input before submission
   - Handle submission loading state

4. Implement keyboard shortcuts:
   - Add Enter key for submission (with shift+Enter for new line)
   - Support for other common chat shortcuts
   - Ensure accessible keyboard interactions

5. Add UI feedback:
   - Implement focus states for the input
   - Add loading spinner or disabled state during submission
   - Include hover states for the submit button
   - Consider character count or other input feedback

## Expected Output
A functional input area component that:
- Captures user input through a form interface
- Handles form submission and validation
- Provides appropriate keyboard shortcuts
- Shows proper loading and interaction states
- Is ready to integrate with the actual message sending functionality

## Notes
- Focus on the UI and form handling in this task
- Actual message sending logic will be implemented in T4_ChatStateManagement
- Consider adding features like input resizing or emoji support as enhancements
- Ensure mobile-friendly interaction especially for on-screen keyboards
