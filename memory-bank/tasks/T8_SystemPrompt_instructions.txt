# T8_SystemPrompt Instructions

## Objective
Create a detailed, high-performing system prompt to guide the AI assistant's diagnostic behavior.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP2_APIIntegration
This task focuses on designing and implementing the system prompt that will instruct the AI assistant on how to conduct the diagnostic conversation.

## Dependencies
- T6_APIRouteSetup (will use the system prompt)
- T7_EnvironmentConfig (API keys)

## Steps
1. ✅ Draft initial system prompt:
   - Define AI assistant persona and tone
   - Outline diagnostic workflow
   - Include instructions for question formulation and analysis

2. ✅ Refine prompt wording:
   - Improve clarity and specificity
   - Add examples if needed
   - Optimize for DeepSeek/OpenAI API

3. ✅ Implement prompt in code:
   - Create `src/lib/prompts/systemPrompt.ts`
   - Export prompt as a string/template
   - Use placeholders for dynamic content

4. ✅ Test prompt integration:
   - Verify prompt is sent correctly in API requests
   - Adjust based on AI response quality

## Expected Output
A well-structured system prompt that:
- Guides the AI through a step-by-step diagnostic process
- Produces relevant, clear, and actionable responses
- Can be dynamically customized with user input
- Is integrated into API requests

## Notes
- Prompt quality is critical for AI performance
- Iterative refinement may be needed based on testing
- Consider prompt length limits for API calls
