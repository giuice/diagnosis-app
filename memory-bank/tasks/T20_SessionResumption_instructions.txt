# T20_SessionResumption Instructions

## Objective
Implement functionality to resume a past diagnostic session, allowing users to continue a previous conversation with the AI assistant.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP4_DiagnosticHistory
This task focuses on creating the capability to load a past diagnostic session into the active chat interface, enabling users to continue conversations that were previously saved to history.

## Dependencies
- T11_SessionStore (provides session data)
- T4_ChatStateManagement (needs to be updated with resumed session)
- T17_SessionViewer (integration point for resume button)
- T1_ChatContainer (target for resumed session)

## Steps
1. Create session resumption functionality:
   - Create file: `src/lib/utils/sessionResumption.ts`
   - Implement function to extract session data
   - Create transformation utilities for session format
   - Add validation for resumable sessions

2. Implement resume button component:
   - Create file: `src/components/history/ResumeButton.tsx`
   - Implement button UI with proper icon
   - Add confirmation dialog if current session has content
   - Create loading state during resumption

3. Create session state handling:
   - Implement function to load session into chat state
   - Add message history transfer functionality
   - Create metadata update for resumed sessions
   - Implement handling for continuation indicators

4. Add transition handling:
   - Create smooth transition to chat interface
   - Implement UI feedback for successful resumption
   - Add auto-scroll to latest message
   - Create focus management for input field

5. Implement error handling:
   - Add validation for corrupted or incompatible sessions
   - Create error feedback for failed resumption
   - Implement recovery mechanisms for partial failures
   - Add logging for debugging issues

## Expected Output
A session resumption system that:
- Allows users to continue previous diagnostic conversations
- Handles the transition from history view to active chat
- Preserves all previous messages and context
- Provides clear feedback during the resumption process
- Manages edge cases and errors appropriately

## Notes
- Consider how to handle the current active session when resuming
- Add visual indicator that the session is a continuation
- Ensure all message history and context is properly transferred
- Consider adding a timestamp or marker for when the session was resumed
- Test with various session lengths and content types
