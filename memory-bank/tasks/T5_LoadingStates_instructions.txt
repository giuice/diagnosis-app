# T5_LoadingStates Instructions

## Objective
Implement visual loading states and indicators for the chat interface to provide feedback during AI response generation and other asynchronous operations.

## Context
Parent Implementation Plan: IP1_ChatInterface
This task focuses on creating responsive loading indicators and states throughout the chat interface to provide visual feedback to users during AI thinking time, message sending, and other operations that might take time to complete.

## Dependencies
- T1_ChatContainer, T2_MessageComponents (will include loading indicators)
- T4_ChatStateManagement (will trigger loading states)
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (optional for animations)

## Steps
1. Design loading indicators:
   - Create file: `src/components/chat/LoadingIndicator.tsx`
   - Implement typing animation for AI message loading
   - Create spinner or pulse animation for general loading
   - Add skeleton components for content placeholders

2. Implement AI response loading state:
   - Add a "thinking" or "typing" indicator for AI messages
   - Implement smooth transition when response arrives
   - Style according to the AI message format

3. Add form submission loading states:
   - Disable input during submission
   - Add visual indicator to submit button
   - Show appropriate feedback during message sending

4. Create error state indicators:
   - Design error message components
   - Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate
   - Ensure errors are clearly communicated

5. Enhance loading states with animations:
   - Add subtle animations to loading indicators
   - Implement smooth transitions between states
   - Ensure animations are not distracting or excessive

## Expected Output
A set of loading state components and implementations that:
- Provide clear visual feedback during asynchronous operations
- Include typed indicators for AI message generation
- Show form submission states appropriately
- Handle error states gracefully
- Enhance the overall user experience with appropriate loading feedback

## Notes
- Focus on creating loading states that enhance user experience without being distracting
- Ensure loading states are accessible (don't rely solely on animations)
- Consider reduced motion preferences for users who prefer minimal animations
- Use consistent visual language across all loading states
