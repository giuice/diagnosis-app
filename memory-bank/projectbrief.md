## üìù Product Requirements Document (PRD) ‚Äì Diagnosis Web App

---

### 1. Overview  
A web-based AI diagnosis assistant that simulates a doctor-patient interaction. Users describe their health issues via a chat interface, and the AI guides them through a conversational diagnostic process using a predefined, high-performing system prompt. Sessions can be exported to PDF and are stored locally for future access.

---

### 2. Goals and Objectives  
- **Primary Goal**: Help users get an intelligent, guided diagnosis using natural conversation.
- **Secondary Goals**:
  - Provide a modern, fast, and responsive UI.
  - Enable users to export diagnostic sessions to PDF.
  - Allow multiple diagnostic sessions with local history.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - High user engagement and satisfaction
  - Reliable AI response relevance
  - Smooth UX with minimal user friction

---

### 3. Target Users  
- Anyone needing a health diagnostic without seeing a doctor immediately.
- Users seeking private, fast, and interactive evaluations.
- No medical or technical expertise required.

### 6. Technical Requirements

| Category              | Technology / Stack           | Purpose |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| **Frontend Framework** | **Next.js (React)**            | SSR + API routes + fast development |
| **Styling**            | **Tailwind CSS**               | Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design |
| **UI Components**      | **shadcn/ui**                  | Modern component system (built on Radix UI) |
| **Icons**              | **Lucide-react**               | Clean, lightweight icons |

| **PDF Export**         | **html2pdf.js** or **jsPDF**   | Generate downloadable PDF of chat |
| **AI Backend**         | **Next.js API Route + OpenAI API** | Secure connection to AI using your custom prompt |
| **Environment Secrets**| `.env.local` & Vercel secrets  | Store `OPENAI_API_KEY` securely |
| **Deployment**         | **Vercel**                     | One-click deploy, serverless API support |

---

### 7. Constraints and Assumptions
- Diagnostic logic is handled entirely by a pre-tested system prompt.
- No user authentication required in MVP.
- All sessions are stored locally (no backend DB).
- LocalStorage is sufficient for history in MVP.
- PDF export is manually triggered by user.

---

### 8. Future Considerations
- Multi-language support
- Authentication for syncing across devices
- Chat session analytics or feedback scoring
- Audio input (voice-to-text)
- Integration with real doctors for review

Perfect‚Äîso now we‚Äôre introducing **persistent diagnostic history** stored *locally* (e.g., in browser local storage). That allows users to:

- Start as many diagnostic sessions as they like
- Revisit and export old ones via a **‚ÄúHistory‚Äù tab**

Got it. Let‚Äôs update the use cases again before moving to Step 5.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Use Case Addition

6. **View Diagnostic History**
   - Actor: User  
   - Flow:
     1. Each time a user finishes or starts a new diagnostic, the previous one is saved in local storage.
     2. User can access a ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù tab.
     3. Each saved session is listed with timestamp or title.
     4. User can view, continue, or export any past session.
